Work experience
======
* July 2017 - Current: Graduate Research Assistant (D.Sc.)
  * Department of Animal Science, ESALQ/USP
  * Advisor: Luiz Lehmann Coutinho
  * Grant number:	88882.328657/2019-01 (CAPES)
  * Currently, my research has focused on Multi-omics Data integration methods applied to Nellore meat tenderness.
  
  * Ouctober 2016- April 2017: Exchange Visitor
  * School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta,GA.
  * Supervisor: Mark Styczynski
  * Grant number:	16/16214-8 (FAPESP)
  *  During the six-months internship I was training on preprocessing, univarite and multivariate analysis for metabolomics.
 
 * Ouctober 2014- June 2017: Graduate Research Assistant (M.Sc.)
  * Department of Medicine Veterinary, FZEA/USP
  * Advisor: Heidge Fukumasu
  * Grant number:	15/01059-4 (FAPESP)
  *  My research was focused to identify potential biomarkers associated with feed efficiency as well as to understand the molecular process that explains feed efficiency variation.
  
* August 2013- June 2014: Technical Assistant
  * CRV Lagoa Ltda, Sertãozinho, São Paulo
  * Dairy Cattle Animal Breeding Program
  * At CRV Lagoa he worked with the database of animal breeding program for dairy cattle, he also supported dairy cattle mating via CRV ’s mating program.
