Hello! I'm Francisco, a Dsc. student in animal science and pastures at the [Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture](http://www.en.esalq.usp.br/) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). I have experience in animal breeding, genetics, and molecular biology. Currently, my research focuses on Omics Data integration methods applied to meat tenderness in Nellore cattle. During my M.Sc., I worked to identify potential biomarkers associated with feed efficiency as well as to understand the molecular process that explains feed efficiency variation.

Outside of my professional life I enjoy cooking, drawing and spending time with family.
