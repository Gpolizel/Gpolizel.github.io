Hello! I'm Francisco, animal scientist with MSc and PhD in animal science and pastures at the University of São Paulo (USP). I have experience in animal breeding, genetics, and molecular biology. During my PhD, at the University of São Paulo, I focused on Multi-omics integration methods applied to meat tenderness in Nellore cattle. On my MSc. research, I committed on identify potential biomarkers associated with feed efficiency as well as to understand the molecular process that explains feed efficiency variation.

Outside of my professional life I enjoy cooking, drawing and spending time with family.
