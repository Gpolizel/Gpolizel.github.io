Hello! I'm Guilherme, a doctor of veterinary medicine, MSc. in animal bioscience at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). I have experience in genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics. During my MSc. research, I committed on identify genes associated with fetal programming as well as understand the molecular process that explains fetal programming responses. Currently, in my PhD research I study the integration of multiomic data (systems biology) to understand the effects of fetal programming in beef cattle.
