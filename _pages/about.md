Hello! I'm Francisco, an animal scientist, MSc. & Ph.D. in animal science and pastures at the University of São Paulo (USP). I have experience in animal breeding, genetics, and molecular biology. During my Ph.D., at the University of São Paulo, I focused on Multi-omics integration methods applied to meat tenderness in Nellore cattle. On my MSc. research, I committed on identify potential biomarkers associated with feed efficiency as well as understand the molecular process that explains feed efficiency variation.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy cooking, drawing, and spending time with family.
