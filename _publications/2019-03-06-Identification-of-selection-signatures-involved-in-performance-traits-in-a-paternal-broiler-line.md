<b>Abstract</b>

Natural and artificial selection leads to changes in certain regions of the genome resulting in selection signatures that can reveal genes associated with the selected traits. Selection signatures may be identified using different methodologies, of which some are based on detecting contiguous sequences of homozygous identical-by-descent haplotypes, called runs of homozygosity (ROH), or estimating fixation index (FST) of genomic windows that indicates genetic differentiation. This study aimed to identify selection signatures in a paternal broiler TT line at generations 7th and 16th of selection and to investigate the genes annotated in these regions as well as the biological pathways involved. For such purpose, ROH and FST-based analysis were performed using whole genome sequence of twenty-eight chickens from two different generations.
